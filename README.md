# To Hell With You
*One death is not the end… unless you're already in hell.*

## Overview
This mod overhauls Minecraft’s death mechanics to introduce a hardcore-inspired twist on survival. With *To Hell With You*, death is just the beginning—unless you're already in the Nether.

## Core Features
- **Second Chance Mechanic:**
  If you die in the Overworld, instead of dying outright, you're cast into the fiery depths of the Nether. You’ll keep your items and have one goal: escape.

- **Final Death in the Nether:**
  Once in the Nether, you're on borrowed time. A special status effect warns you that any further death here is *permanent*. If you die in the Nether, it's game over—items lost.

- **Return and Redemption:**
  Survive the Nether and make it back to the Overworld? Congrats—you’ve earned a second chance. Your life continues, but death will once again banish you to hell.

## Why Use This Mod?
Perfect for players looking for:
- A fresh twist on Hardcore mode
- High-stakes gameplay with a built-in “last chance” system  
- More meaningful death mechanics in survival worlds

Whether you're a masochist looking for punishment or a strategist craving high-stakes adventure, *To Hell With You* will change the way you think about death in Minecraft.
